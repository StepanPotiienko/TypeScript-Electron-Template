# Typescript Electron Template
Hello! If followed correctly, this short introduction should get you up and running as soon as possible. 

## Short Introduction
  ### What is this repository for?
  This repository was originally designed to make developing TypeScript/Electron apps as easy and productive as possible. 

  ### Who am I?
  I am Stepan Potiienko, jag kommer fr√•n Ukraina. I started learning "programming" at the age of 11-12. Programming was cool back then and if you were dating a girl and she by some chance found out 
  that you "do cool stuff on the computer" - there is no way she would cheat on you. But anyway, here I am writing this nonsense. 

  ### Who is this repository for?
  This repository was made to not only save me a lot of time developing the next brilliant-idea application but also make it as smooth as possible when introducing new programmers to Electron Development.
  You do not need to know a lot to begin developing: basic git knowledge and understanding of application design. Well, I am here to help! (:

## Getting started
  ### Forking the repository
  There is this conveniently placed "Fork" button that triggers my programming senses. I do not know if it is true, but I assume it is used to fork the repo. Maybe you should check it out, would you?

  When you do press the button, it will automatically create a copy of the repository and you are good to go.
